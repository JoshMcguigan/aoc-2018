# Advent of Code 2018

Each days challenge is in a separate module. The tests for a given day can be run with `cargo test -- dayNN` where NN is the day number with a leading zero if needed.

My goal is to use these challenges to test out Rust libraries that I don't have much experience with, in particular the various parsing libraries. For that reason, the solutions may be longer than a typical Advent of Code solution. But I hope they will also be readable and robust.
